Title: Queue-Based Simulations in C

Description:
This C code showcases the practical use of queues in a variety of scenarios. It includes four queue-based simulations, each demonstrating how queues can efficiently manage tasks or customers in different real-world contexts:

Supermarket Checkout Lanes: Simulates multiple checkout lanes in a supermarket. Customers arrive at lanes, and their processing is managed using a queue-based approach.

Traffic Management at Intersections: Demonstrates traffic management at intersections. Vehicles arrive at an intersection, and they are managed based on the order of arrival.

Call Center Waiting Queue: Simulates a call center's customer queue. Customers call in, and their calls are processed in a first-come-first-serve manner.

Bank Customer Service Queue: Similar to the call center scenario, this simulation focuses on a bank's customer service queue.

The code provides a clear example of how queues can streamline the management of tasks or customers in diverse scenarios. It includes structures for customers, nodes, and queues, along with essential queue operations such as enqueue and dequeue. Additionally, the code includes functions to handle customer interactions and allows users to choose and run specific simulations interactively.

Explore these simulations to gain insights into queue-based solutions for common real-world challenges.



Title: Tower of Hanoi Solver in C

Description:
This C code presents an efficient solver for the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, a challenging mathematical problem that involves transferring a stack of disks from one peg to another while following specific rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg.
The goal is to move all the disks from the source peg to the destination peg, using an intermediate peg, in the fewest possible moves.
Key Features:

Implementation of a stack data structure for representing the three pegs (A, B, and C).
Clear and concise functions for stack operations, including push and pop.
Intelligent disk movement logic adhering to the Tower of Hanoi rules.
Interactive user input to specify the number of disks for the puzzle.
Detailed step count display, showcasing the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle.
Use this code as an educational tool to understand the Tower of Hanoi problem and its solution algorithm. It offers a practical example of stack-based data structures and algorithmic problem-solving in C.
